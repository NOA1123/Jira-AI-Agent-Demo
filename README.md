# Jira-AI-Agent-Demo
This project implements an AI-powered Jira agent that automatically generates user stories and test cases from Jira epics or mock feature data. The system uses Google's Gemini AI (with fallback templates) to create comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria and corresponding test cases.
